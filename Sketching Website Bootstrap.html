        <p> <b>Purpose of Sketching</b> <br> A sketch may serve a number of purposes: It might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle. <br> Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. </p></div>

        <p><strong><center> <span style="font-size:35px;"> Famous Sketch Artists <hr> </strong></span>  <strong> <span style="font-size: larger;"> 1. Adonna Khare </span> </strong> <br>   Adonna Khare is an American master carbonpencil artist. Her style has been compared to the photo-realistic illustrations of Audubon, but the surreal worlds and strange inhabitants she creates can only spring from her imagination. Khare's life-size works, which she is focusing on more and more, possess the scope of a painting, but with enough detail and realism to give viewers the impression they can step through the paper and into Adonna's worlds. <br> <br>The winner of 2012 ArtPrize Competition, Adonna Khare is a contemporary artist from the United States who combines realistic depictions of animals with fabulist, image-based storytelling. She tries to create work that is relevant to our world, but in doing so, she asks us to see her messages through different perspectives. <br> <br>Adonna Khare's artwords are large-scale carbon and graphite pencil drawings. Adonna Khare has currently put together a coloring book of her work, so that you can join in on the beauty of her imagined animal-based world while practicing your colored pencil skills. She says of her process, "I draw how one might sculpt," and the final artworks contain far more layers of pencil than the surface belies. A review of her in-progress piecess reveal hints of skeleton, almost as if she is drawing her fictional subjects from the inside out. </p>

        <p><strong><center> <span style="font-size:larger;"> <br> 2. Maqbool Fida Husain <br> </span> </strong> <br> Maqbool Fida Husain better known as M.F. Husain was born on 17th of September 1915 in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, in a Suleymani Bohra family. He picked up taste in art through studing calligraphy while he stayed at a Madrasa in Baroda. He was an Indian artist known for executing bold, vibrantly coloured narrative paintings in a modified Cubist style. <br> <br> Early in his career, Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai to earn additional income, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often travelled to Gujarat to paint landscapes whenever he could afford to travel. Husain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry. This was a clique of young artists who wished to break with the nationalist traditions established by the <b>Bengal School of Art</b> and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level.<br> <br> Although he waas awarded such National Honours as the Padma Bhusan(1973) and the Padma Vibhushan (1991), Husain a secular Muslim, triggered criticism for his often irreverent treatment of sensitive subject matter, including Hindu Goddesses painted as nudes. One of his best-known paintings, commonly known as "Bharatmata" or "Mother India", depicted a bright red nude woman contorted into the shape of the Indian Subcontinent. Other significant works include <i>Man</i>(1951), <i>Vishwamitra </i>(1973), and <i>Passage Through Human Space</i>, <i>a series of watercolours </i> completed in the mid-1970s.<br> <br> He was one of the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artists of the 20th century. He was one of the founding member of <b>Bombay Progressive Artists Group </b> M.F.Husain is associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His themes- sometimes treated in series-include topics as diverse as Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British Raj and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. </b></p>
